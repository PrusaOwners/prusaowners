# 2018 Christmas Ornament Design Competition

## What is this?
The 602 Wasteland wants to have some friendly competition around the design of some sweet Christmas ornaments!

## Ornament Guidelines
While we don't want to stifle people's creative urges, we do have some design guidelines.

1. Shoot for a small to medium sized ornament, 3" or so. Ability to be scaled is awesome,
2. Should include an eyelet for string attachment for hanging,
3. Multi part entries are welcome, providing assembly is snap together or easily sourced (super glue),
4. Multi material entries are welcome, providing that a single filament option is made available as well,
5. Should be printable in PLA without much difficulty or specific hardware,
6. A photo of a completed ornament should be provided with your entry. This ensures you're providing a printable ornament and gives us something to put up for judging,
7. Ornament should be freely available on Thingiverse with a non restrictive license,
8. Multiple ornament designs are welcome; however, in the interest of keeping things fair, we ask that you photograph them together and enter them as one entry.

## Entry
Once you have completed your design, please get a photo and link to the Thingiverse post to your local 602 Wasteland admin. We have a behind the scenes channel to dump all this into, and we'll make it available for judging early in December! Entries are being accepted now!

## Prizes
The main prize of this competition is obviously the chance to show off your design skills; however, we're hoping the community will donate some small prizes (roll of filament, etc). Number of prize winners to be determined by how many prize contributions we receive.

## Judging
Judging will be decided by The 602 Wasteland community via the #announcements channel by reaction count. This will take the load off the admins for this and allow for them to enter as well.

## Have fun!
