# 2018 Christmas Ornament Design Competition [DRAFT]

## Draft
This design competition is still strictly in a "being figured out" stage and may or may not happen! We're using git to figure out how we'd like this to take place.

## Ornament Guidelines
While we don't want to stifle people's creative urges, we do have some design guidelines.

1. Shoot for a small to medium sized ornament, 3" or so. Ability to be scaled is awesome,
2. Should include an eyelet for string attachment for hanging,
3. Multi part entries are welcome, providing assembly is snap together or easily sourced (super glue),
4. Multi material entries are welcome, providing that a single filament option is made available,
5. Should be printable in PLA without much difficulty or specific hardware,
6. A photo of a completed ornament should be provided with your entry. This ensures you're providing a printable ornament and gives us something to put up for judging,
7. Ornament should be freely available on Thingiverse with a non restrictive license.

## Prizes
The main prize of this competition is obviously the chance to show off your design skills; however, some of us are contributing a bit for some prizes. Once we figure out how to do this without committing legal suicide, we'll list them here.

## Judging
Judging will be decided by The 602 Wasteland community via the #announcements channel by reaction count. This will take the load off the admins for this and allow for them to enter as well.
