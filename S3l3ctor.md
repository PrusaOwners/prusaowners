[This is S3l3ctor](https://github.com/PrusaOwners/s3l3ctor/blob/master/images/s3l3ctor.png), an open source, sub $100, 6 chroma filament selector system currently under development. You can print any color (up to 6) you want without changing your extruder design.



[PLA_bearings](PLA_bearings "wikilink")

S3l3ctor is:
* A 100% open source filament selector
* Costs under $120
* Can use up to 6 colors at once
* Lets you keep your extruder
* Can work on any printer with a USB port or spare pins
* Being developed by Matt when he's not doing homework
* Is undergoing closed Alpha testing right now

S3l3ctor is **not**:
* Done yet
* Accepting donations not made in 4043d
* A MMU2 clone
* Requires changing extruder hardware
* For the faint of heart (yet!)

S3l3ctor is an open source filament selector under development. Development is being led by ThatMattGuy (Matt) in collaboration with other community members.

At this point the project is undergoing closed alpha testing and will have an open beta starting soon<sup>TM</sup>. I mean you print the parts, but it's likely not a good idea yet.

# Assembly

### Shaft preperation

Begin by filing, grinding or otherwise abrating a flat a mm or two deep (doesn't really matter), and about 5mm long. While you have the shaft out, make sure that your 625 bearings will slide smoothly along the shaft. They shouldn't slide smoothly like a linear bearing, but at the same time they should not need pounding. A more scientific way to quantify this is with a calipers - if the bearings' ID is more than 30 micron undersized (4.97mm or so), the fit on the 5mm rod is going to be close. Like, probubly too close. I reccomend measuring bearings and
